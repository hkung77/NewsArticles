The Maple Leafs were bad this season, and Brendan Shanahan can't promise when they will get better.
After a weekend where the team president fired two dozen of his staff, Shanahan didn't put a timetable on a rebuild. But history shows that the light at the end of the tunnel doesn't have to be light years away. Emerging youngsters, some deft player signings, and a little luck can change things quickly.
The Philadelphia Flyers dumped their general manager and head coach in the 2006-07 season and, within three years, they climbed all the way to the Stanley Cup final.
The Flyers were a team in turmoil eight years ago. Leadership became a problem when they lost Michal Handzus, Kim Johnsson, Eric Desjardins and Keith Primeau to injuries. Peter Forsberg took over as captain, but his effectiveness was limited by a chronic foot injury.
Early that season, Bobby Clarke resigned as general manager and head coach Ken Hitchcock was fired. Assistant coach John Stevens replaced Hitchcock, and assistant GM Paul Holmgren assumed Clarke's.
The moves did not pay immediate dividends, as the Flyers finished with the worst record in the NHL. But change started to come in the summer.
Holmgren acquired the rights to negotiate with impending free agents Kimmo Timonen and Scott Hartnell in June 2007, and their signings provided a veteran presence and some toughness. The Flyers also dipped into the free-agent market to sign Buffalo sniper Danny Briere to a long-term deal.
The next season, the Flyers - despite a 10-game February losing streak - were the sixth seed in the East and advanced to the conference final against Pittsburgh. In 2008-09, rookie Claude Giroux emerged as a future star. The Flyers reached the playoffs as the fifth seed but lost to Pittsburgh in the first round.
There were more changes before the 2009-10 season, with goaltenders Ray Emery and Brian Boucher replacing free agents Martin Biron and Antero Niittymaki and, more importantly, with the Flyers acquiring defenceman Chris Pronger from Anaheim.
The Flyers still stumbled early in the seasons and Stevens lost his job, replaced by Peter Laviolette. But Pronger, young stars Mike Richards and Jeff Carter, who both topped 30 goals in the regular season, and goaltending surprise Michael Leighton helped them sneak into the playoffs as the seventh seed, a point ahead of the ninth-place Rangers.
Injuries to Boucher and Emery, who had season-ending hip surgery, had opened the door for Leighton, who was picked up off waivers in December and started with an 8-0-1 run before getting hurt in March.
The Flyers upset the Devils in the first round, then stunned the Bruins in the second, coming back from a 3-0 series deficit, and a 3-0 Game 7 deficit, with Leighton returning to the net after a Boucher injury.
Leighton then set a franchise record by recording three shutouts in the conference final, and the Flyers eliminated Montreal in five games.
The Flyers fell to Chicago in the Stanley Cup final, but showed that successful rebuilds don't have to take years, and that there isn't one straight line to success. They fired Hitchcock, and dumped his successor Stevens before finding the right coach in Laviolette.
Shanahan's rebuild will also, no doubt, suffer some setbacks along the way, but fans might not have to wait years for results.
