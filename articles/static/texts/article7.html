Tim Tebow is back in the NFL - at least for now.
The former Heisman Trophy winner and journeyman quarterback is set to sign a contract with the Philadelphia Eagles on Monday, according to multiple reports. Fox Sports' Jay Glazer was the first to report the story.
The signing would reunite Tebow with fellow signal-caller Mark Sanchez, whom he played with on the New York Jets in 2012. The Eagles also acquired Sam Bradford via trade this offseason, sending Nick Foles to the St. Louis Rams in the deal. The team also traded running back LeSean McCoy to the Buffalo Bills, and leading receiver Jeremy Maclin signed with the Kansas City Chiefs in free agency.
Tebow worked as a college football analyst for ESPN last season. His last NFL work was before the 2013 season, when he participated in training camp with the New England Patriots.
Tebow first rose to NFL fame in the 2011 season with the Broncos in which he lead the team to a playoff victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers. He was Denver's first-round pick in 2010 following a decorated college career at Florida.
In three seasons, Tebow completed 173 of 361 passes for 2,422 yards, 17 touchdowns and 9 interceptions.
