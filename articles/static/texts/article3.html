The cost of public cussing has gone up considerably in NBA circles.
Raptors president Masai Ujiri, fined $25,000 (U.S.) a year ago for dropping an 'F' bomb during a fan rally, was hit with a $35,000 penalty Sunday for saying at the same kind of celebration he "didn't give a s--- about it" in reference to a statement made by Washington's Paul Pierce.
The Raptors organization was also hit with a $25,000 fine for Ujiri's speech at a fan rally outside the Air Canada Centre before the team's 93-86 loss to the Wizards on Saturday afternoon.
Ujiri vows to keep his language cleaner in the future.
"I have the deepest respect for commissioner (Adam) Silver and the NBA, and while showing passion for our team and fans I will choose my words more carefully in the future so as not to indicate otherwise," Ujiri said in a statement released by the team.
Ujiri's original statement came after Pierce said he wasn't concerned about the Raptors because "I don't feel they have the 'it' that makes you worried."
"People want me to say something about Paul Pierce but, we don't give a (expletive) about 'it'," Ujiri said Saturday outside the arena while Silver was inside getting to watch his first game in Toronto as the league's commissioner.
