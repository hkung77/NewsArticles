It was unintentional comedy of the worst kind.
Phil Kessel was asked how he planned to spend the off-season, that five-month-plus vacation that the Maple Leafs have become accustomed to beginning this time of year, and he offered a straight-faced response. Speaking as the club cleaned out its dressing room on Monday, Kessel said he'd take some time off - because, you know, the previous few months of meaningless gliding weren't enough of a break - before he gets back to work.
"Then I'll go and train hard," he said, "like I always do."
You know what they say about the greats: They're their own worst critics, which at least partly explains why Kessel can still only be considered a great talent brimming with untapped potential. Gifted with 50-goal skills, he just hung his head through a 25-goal dud. He should be, at age 27, in the heart of his prime. Instead, he is slouching through a steep decline. And now he also appears to be in denial, at least publicly, about the well-established idea that his off-season work ethic is a considerable part of the problem. Even Kessel's biggest allies shake their heads in disappointment at how he has refused to mature as a pro.
When you consider all that, and if you listened to Leafs president Brendan Shanahan's state-of-the-franchise press conference on Monday, you could easily get the impression that Kessel isn't long for Toronto.
