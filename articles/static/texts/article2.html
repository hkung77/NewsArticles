Just a few hours after the Washington Wizards opened the NBA playoffs in front of a hostile Toronto crowd, they were snug in their own beds, having flown back to D.C. after the game.
But the comforts of home had to wait until they withstood the travails of the road, which is something this team has proven adept at doing, especially in the playoffs. The Wizards have now captured six of their last seven post-season road games, including their 93-86 overtime win against the Raptors on Saturday.
That's no small feat, especially when it's done in a place like Toronto, which Washington's well-seasoned team veteran described as one of the toughest environments for a visiting team that he's seen during his more than 16 years in the pros.
"It's one of the best crowds I've ever been a part of on the road," said Paul Pierce, who was the target of much derision from fans at the Air Canada Centre on Saturday. "Paul Pierce Sucks!" was a steady refrain.
"I enjoy getting a win on the road more than I do at home," he said. "When you win Game 1 on the road, it kind of sets the tone and the mindset ... It takes the pressure off us and puts it on them."
The Wizards, who practised in Washington on Sunday, came out with a fresh game plan to beat the Raptors. Coach Randy Wittman put Pierce and Drew Gooden at the four spot for long stretches, employing a smaller, quicker contingent to outpace Toronto and change the matchups that Washington had trouble with during the regular season, when the Raptors swept them in three games.
"They have some luxuries at playing small at the four and spreading the floor," said Raptors coach Dwane Casey on Sunday, who added that his team had reviewed film of Washington using such a formation before the game.
"We just didn't execute the pick-and-roll coverage very well," Casey said.
